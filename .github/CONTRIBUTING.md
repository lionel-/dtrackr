# How to contribute:

Dive in. Raise an issue, fork the code, hack it about, show me what you've done. I'll try and respond to comments on issues, and update my development plans there. I'm just one person with a life to lead though, so 
please be kind. Offers of help are always welcome.

If you are reporting an issue please could you try and reproduce it using one of the data sets I've used in the vignettes (e.g. iris, diamonds, mtcars, dtrackr::ILPD ) or include the data set in your issue.
If you can also tell me exactly what you expect to see in the flowchart that isn't there, that would be helpful.

## Testing

I'd love some help with better test cases. 

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/terminological/dtrackr/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 

For commits I've set up the repo to not run the R CMD check workflow for commits that contain the phrase "no check".

## Coding conventions

Start reading my code and you'll probably want to cry. I apologize. You can probably do better.

Thanks,
Rob Challen.
