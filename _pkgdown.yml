- title: "S3 tidyverse extensions"
  desc: >
    S3 functions extend the behaviour of a subset of the `dplyr` or `tidyr` commands
    that operate on dataframes, and return dataframes, to include a history graph. In general
    these work the same as the normal `dplyr` functions but allow additional
    parameters that capture the history as they are executed.
