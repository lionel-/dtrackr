## Other info
This version 0.2.5 updates previous CRAN release 0.2.4

Updates following JOSS code review, detailed changes described in NEWS.md. 

* Mainly improvements in documentation, test coverage, examples, and supporting 
documentation such as contributor statements. 
* Some additional functionality but no breaking changes in existing functions 
or configuration. 
* Changes in documentation have resulted in additional `Suggests` dependencies 
on CRAN packages.
* Updated maintainer email to longer term stable email address. URLs in 
DESCRIPTION updated to point to github source.
* There are some spelling issues that arise from documentation inherited from 
`dplyr`and `tidyr` equivalent functions, that would need to be fixed upstream.

Many thanks.
