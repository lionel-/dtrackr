\title{Get the dtrackr history graph}
\usage{
p_get(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{a dataframe which may be grouped}
}
\value{
the history graph. This is a list, of class trackr_graph, containing the following named items:
\itemize{
\item excluded - the data items that have been excluded thus far as a nested dataframe
\item tags - a dataframe of tag-value pairs containing the summary of the data at named points in the data flow (see \code{\link[=tagged]{tagged()}})
\item nodes - a dataframe of the nodes of the flow chart
\item edges - an edgelist (as a dataframe) of the relationships between the nodes in the flow chart
\item head - the current most recent nodes added into the graph as a dataframe.
}

The format of this data may grow over time but these fields are unlikely to be changed.
}
\description{
This provides the raw history graph and is not really intended for mainstream use.
The internal structure of the graph is explained below. print and plot S3 methods exist for
the dtrackr history graph.

\examples{
library(dplyr)
library(dtrackr)
graph = iris \%>\% track() \%>\% comment("A comment") \%>\% history()
print(graph)
